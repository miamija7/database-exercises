*** MySQL - Relationships ***

The R in RDBMS stands for Relational.
MySQL offers us a lot of power through its ability to relate data from different tables.
We use SQL to manage data across several tables.



===================== INDEXES =====================


Indexes (Indices):
- optimize queries and ensure integrity of data

Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the
first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this
costs. If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek
to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. If a table has 1,000 rows, this is at
least 100 times faster than reading sequentially. If you need to access most of the rows, it is faster to read
sequentially, because this minimizes disk seeks.



Using Indexes:
- a primary key is the unique identifier for each row
- ability to easily reference the data in a row
- MySQL will make sure there are never duplicates



Primary Keys:
The primary key for a table represents the column or set of columns that you use in your most vital queries.
It has an associated index, for fast query performance. Query performance benefits from the NOT NULL optimization,
because it cannot include any NULL values.

- Typically we add the PRIMARY KEY index on our id column, along with AUTO_INCREMENT.

    // performing queries on the id will be very fast
    CREATE TABLE quotes (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        author VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        content VARCHAR(240) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );



Unique:
- Optimization is the primary focus of indexes
- we can use indexes to ensure uniqueness and create relationships
- UNIQUE indexes work very similar to primary keys
- unique indexes are not limited to 1 per table
- add a UNIQUE constraint on a column to make sure there are no duplicates

    ALTER TABLE quotes
    ADD UNIQUE (content);

    mysql> DESCRIBE quotes;
    +---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field   | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | id      | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | content | varchar(240) | NO   | UNI | NULL    |                |
    | author  | varchar(50)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    +---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    3 rows in set (0.00 sec)



Foreign Keys:
- foreign keys relate tables that will be used in joins

If a table has many columns, and you query different combinations of columns, it might be efficient to split
the less-frequently used data into separate tables with a few columns each, and relate them back to the main
table by duplicating the numeric ID column from the main table. That way, each small table can have a primary
key for fast lookups of its data, and you can query just the set of columns that you need using a join operation.



Multiple-Column Indexes:
- MySQL can create composite indexes (that is, indexes on multiple columns).
- An index may consist of up to 16 columns.

    CREATE TABLE authors (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id),
        UNIQUE (first_name, last_name)
    );

- this creates a new table named authors
- the unique key constraint is on the combined values of first_name and last_name


===================== Indexes EXERCISE =====================

USE employees;

DESCRIBE departments;
DESCRIBE dept_emp;
DESCRIBE dept_manager;
DESCRIBE employees;
DESCRIBE salaries;
DESCRIBE titles;


USE codeup_test_db;

ALTER TABLE albums
ADD UNIQUE (name, artist);

INSERT INTO albums (artist, name)
VALUES ('Adele', '21');
#ERROR: [23000][1062] Duplicate entry '21-Adele' for key 'albums.name'

DESCRIBE albums;

SHOW TABLES;


===================== JOINS =====================

JOIN:
- JOIN tables, usually based on a foreign key relationship
- obtain query results from more than one table in a single query
- types of joins:
    + JOIN, a.k.a INNER JOIN
    + LEFT JOIN
    + RIGHT JOIN



JOIN Syntax:
- JOIN describes the table that will be joining the query
- ON describes the relationship

    SELECT columns
    FROM table_a as A
    JOIN table_b as B ON A.id = B.fk_id;

- table_a is the left table of the join
- table_b is the right table of the join



JOIN Example DB:

    CREATE TABLE roles (
      id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

    CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      role_id INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id),
      FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles (id)
    );

    INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('admin');
    INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('author');
    INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('reviewer');
    INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('commenter');

    INSERT INTO users (name, email, role_id) VALUES
    ('bob', 'bob@example.com', 1),
    ('joe', 'joe@example.com', 2),
    ('sally', 'sally@example.com', 3),
    ('adam', 'adam@example.com', 3),
    ('jane', 'jane@example.com', null),
    ('mike', 'mike@example.com', null);



Join / Inner Join:

    SELECT users.name as user_name, roles.name as role_name
    FROM users
    JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id;

    +-----------+-----------+
    | user_name | role_name |
    +-----------+-----------+
    | bob       | admin     |
    | joe       | author    |
    | sally     | reviewer  |
    | adam      | reviewer  |
    +-----------+-----------+
    4 rows in set (0.00 sec)



Left Join:
- retrieve all the records from the left table, regardless of a corresponding record in the right table

    SELECT users.name AS user_name, roles.name AS role_name
    FROM users
    LEFT JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id;

    +-----------+-----------+
    | user_name | role_name |
    +-----------+-----------+
    | bob       | admin     |
    | joe       | author    |
    | sally     | reviewer  |
    | adam      | reviewer  |
    | jane      | NULL      |
    | mike      | NULL      |
    +-----------+-----------+
    6 rows in set (0.00 sec)



Right Join:
- retrieve all the records from the right table, regardless of a corresponding record in the left table
- not as common as LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN can be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN by changing the order of the tables in the query

    SELECT users.name AS user_name, roles.name AS role_name
    FROM users
    RIGHT JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id;

    +-----------+-----------+
    | user_name | role_name |
    +-----------+-----------+
    | bob       | admin     |
    | joe       | author    |
    | sally     | reviewer  |
    | adam      | reviewer  |
    | NULL      | commenter |
    +-----------+-----------+
    5 rows in set (0.00 sec)



Associative Tables and Joins:
- associative table / join table
- a table which creates associations between tables

    SELECT CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS full_name, d.dept_name
    FROM employees as e
    JOIN dept_emp as de
      ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
    JOIN departments as d
      ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no
    WHERE de.to_date = '9999-01-01' AND e.emp_no = 10001;


===================== Joins EXERCISE =====================

CREATE DATABASE join_test_db;

USE join_test_db;

CREATE TABLE roles (
  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  role_id INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles (id)
);

INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('admin');
INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('author');
INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('reviewer');
INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES ('commenter');

INSERT INTO users (name, email, role_id) VALUES
('bob', 'bob@example.com', 1),
('joe', 'joe@example.com', 2),
('sally', 'sally@example.com', 3),
('adam', 'adam@example.com', 3),
('jane', 'jane@example.com', null),
('mike', 'mike@example.com', null);



===================== SUBQUERIES =====================

Subqueries:
- also called nested queries, refers to having more than one query expression in a query


Using Subqueries:
- Subqueries are helpful when we want to find if a value is within a subset of acceptable values.
- A nested query follows this syntax:

    SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c
    FROM table_a
    WHERE column_a IN (
        SELECT column_a
        FROM table_b
        WHERE column_b = true
    );

- From our employees database, we can use this example query to find all the department managers names and birth dates:

    SELECT first_name, last_name, birth_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_no IN (
        SELECT emp_no
        FROM dept_manager
    )
    LIMIT 10;

- That query should return the following result:

    +------------+--------------+------------+
    | first_name | last_name    | birth_date |
    +------------+--------------+------------+
    | Margareta  | Markovitch   | 1956-09-12 |
    | Vishwani   | Minakawa     | 1963-06-21 |
    | Ebru       | Alpin        | 1959-10-28 |
    | Isamu      | Legleitner   | 1957-03-28 |
    | Shirish    | Ossenbruggen | 1953-06-24 |
    | Karsten    | Sigstam      | 1958-12-02 |
    | Krassimir  | Wegerle      | 1956-06-08 |
    | Rosine     | Cools        | 1961-09-07 |
    | Shem       | Kieras       | 1953-10-04 |
    | Oscar      | Ghazalie     | 1963-07-27 |
    +------------+--------------+------------+

- Subqueries can be also useful while you are building INSERT / UPDATE statements where you don't know exactly
  what ID needs to be inserted as a foreign key as the following example demonstrates:

    INSERT INTO users (name, email, role_id)
        VALUES('fer', 'fer@codeup.com',
            (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'commenter')
        );

- The following example uses a subquery to get the primary key for the roles table by only knowing the name of
  the role and just modifies a specific user by their email.

   UPDATE users
       SET role_id = (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'admin')
       WHERE email = 'fer@codeup.com';
