*** mySQL - MySQL Console Setup w/ IntelliJ ***


IntelliJ features a database tool window that allows us to interact with our databases through IntelliJ
The database console tool allows us to connect to available databases and execute queries on the fly.


Setting up The Database Connection:
IntelliJ
1. View -> Tool Windows -> Database -> '+' -> Data Source -> MySQL
2. Might require server version: MySQL 8.x.x
3.  Host: localhost
    Port: 3306
    Database:
    User: root
    Password: (your root password)
    No database selected
    (NOTE: leave the "Database" field blank so you can see all)
    serverTimezone: UTC
    schemas -> [X] All Schemas
4. Click Test Connection and save if successful (update drivers/analyze exceptions)
5. You should be dropped into the db console


Accessing the Database Console:
1. Open the database tool window
2. ^control + click -> choose 'open console' or click icon near the top (the dialect of SQL, select MySQL)
3. command + enter in console to run one or more queries
