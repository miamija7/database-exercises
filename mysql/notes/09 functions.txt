*** MySQL - Functions ***

Functions:
- MySQL has several built-in functions that we can use in our queries
- There is also the ability to create user-defined functions; however, this is a more advanced topic


Using MySQL Functions:

String Functions/Date and Time Functions:
CONCAT()            takes in any number of strings or column names and concatenates them all together
NOW()               get current timestamp => CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
DAY()               get day of the month for date, 1 to 31, or 0 => DAYOFMONTH()
MONTH()             get month from date
YEAR()              get year from date
CURDATE()           current date: YYYY-MM-DD
CURTIME()           current time: HH:MM:SS
UNIX_TIMESTAMP()    the number of seconds since midnight January 1st, 1970
DATEDIFF()          get number of days between dates


    | SELECT *
    | FROM employees
    | WHERE year(birth_date) BETWEEN 1950 AND 1959
    |   AND month(birth_date) = 7
    |   AND day(birth_date) = 4;
