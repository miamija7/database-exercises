*** MySQL - Group By ***

GROUP BY clause:
- remove duplicates
- group based on data in columns
- combine GROUP BY with aggregate functions
- Any column(s) that appear in the SELECT should also be in the GROUP BY clause.

    // syntax

    SELECT column FROM table GROUP BY column_name;
    ----------------------------------------------
    // GROUP BY returns only the unique occurrences of the column specified

    SELECT DISTINCT first_name
    FROM employees;

    SELECT first_name
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY first_name;
    ----------------------------------------------
    // GROUP BY multiple columns

    SELECT last_name, first_name
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY last_name, first_name;



Aggregate Functions:
- aggregate functions works with data across all the rows in our result
- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html

MIN()           get maximum
MAX()           get minimum
AVG()           get average
SUM()           get sum
STDDEV()        statistical analysis
VARIANCE()      statistical analysis
COUNT()         get the number of non-null expression values in a result

    COUNT(*)

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

    // count all first names that do not have an 'a'
    SELECT COUNT(first_name)
    FROM employees
    WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%';



Using GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions:
- produce more meaningful results
- find out how many unique first names do not contain an 'a'
- combine this with the aggregate COUNT function to find how many employees have each unique last nam

    SELECT first_name, COUNT(first_name)
    FROM employees
    WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%'
    GROUP BY first_name;

    SELECT hire_date, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY hire_date
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10;
