*** MySQL - Clauses ***

Clauses: further stipulations added to our queries that determine which rows are targeted


WHERE:
- condition(s) for rows to be selected
- evaluates to true
- default is ALL rows if WHERE is not present

    // WHERE
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date = '1985-01-01';

    // WHERE + LIKE + %(wildcards)
    SELECT first_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

    // DISTINCT: no duplicate values
    SELECT DISTINCT first_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE first_name LIKE '%sus%';

    // WHERE + IN
    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE last_name IN ('Herber', 'Dredge', 'Lipner', 'Baek');

    // WHERE + comparison operators
    <   >   =   >=  <=
    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_no <= 10026;

    // WHERE + IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
    SELECT emp_no, title
    FROM titles
    WHERE to_date IS NOT NULL;

    // chain an IN clause with any of the clauses, using AND and OR
    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE last_name IN ('Herber','Baek')
      AND emp_no < 20000;

    // chain as many of these as we please
    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_no < 20000
      AND last_name IN ('Herber','Baek')
       OR first_name = 'Shridhar';

    // force evaluation grouping using ()
    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_no < 20000
      AND (
          last_name IN ('Herber','Baek')
       OR first_name = 'Shridhar'
    );
