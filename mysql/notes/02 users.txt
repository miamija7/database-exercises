*** mySQL - USERS ***

Database Users:
- MySQL server is a multi-user system

SELECT current_user;                                            determine the user we are currently connected as
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;                              usernames and hosts connection
CREATE USER 'name'@'localhost/ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';     create a user and give password (ip = remote ip address)


Privileges:
- Creating a user is only half of the process, a user has no "privileges"
- it does not have the permission to do anything within the MySQL server

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'name'@'localhost';                     grant all privileges on all databases and tables to a user
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'name'@'localhost';                  grant read-only privileges on all databases and tables to a user
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'name'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;   grant user all privileges + ability to grant other users
SHOW GRANTS for 'username'@'hostname';                      find out the current privileges of a user
DROP USER 'sally'@'localhost';                              removing a user (Be extremely careful with this command!)


// more privilege assignment examples
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON sally_db.sallys_table TO 'sally'@'localhost';
GRANT CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, DROP ON office_db.* TO 'office_user'@'localhost';
