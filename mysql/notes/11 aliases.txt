*** MySQL - Aliases ***

Aliases allow us to assign a temporary name to a column or table.

Using Aliases:
- make temporary names for joins
- change the output of a column's name
- use the AS keyword to assign an alias to a column name or table

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
    FROM employees
    LIMIT 25;

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
    FROM employees
    ORDER BY full_name
    LIMIT 25;

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY full_name, last_name
    ORDER BY last_name
    LIMIT 25;

    --------------------- PREV EXAMPLE ---------------------
    SELECT hire_date, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY hire_date
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10;

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
    FROM employees AS emp
    GROUP BY full_name, last_name
    ORDER BY last_name
    LIMIT 25;

WARNING:
Don't use aliases in WHERE clauses.

It is not permissible to refer to a column alias in a WHERE clause, because the column value might not yet be
determined when the WHERE clause is executed. This query will fail with an error:

    SELECT birth_date, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, gender
    FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date='1985-01-01'
      AND full_name='Arie Staelin';
