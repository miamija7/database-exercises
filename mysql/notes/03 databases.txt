*** mySQL - Creating a Database ***

CREATE DATABASE database_name;                      create a new database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name;        create a database if it does not already exists
SHOW DATABASES;                                     list databases

USE database_name;                                  switch to a particular database
database_name.table_name                            refer to a table or object in a separate database
SELECT database();                                  currently database selected (NULL = no db selected)
SHOW CREATE DATABASE database_name;                 find out the query used to create a database

DROP DATABASE database_name;                        remove a database from MySQL
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;              remove a database if it exists


RDBMS:
- Relational Database Management Systems


Database vs. Schema:
- RDBMSs use schemas as a second level of organization within databases
- they strictly separate databases from each other from the user's perspective
- in MySQL, "database" and "schema" mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably


Application Specific Databases (and Users):
- developing an application backed by a database, you must decide how to organize that information within your database
- most web applications can be encapsulated in a single database
- we will usually pair our application's database with a dedicated user giving full control of just that database

SECURITY: if our application's user is somehow compromised, attackers only have access to the
data for that application, not to any other database on our server.

NOTE: Most other RDBMSs take this practice one step further, treating users & schemas interchangeably,
or declaring that a schema is "owned" by a particular user. MySQL is unique in that it completely separates
the idea of "users" from "databases / schemas"
